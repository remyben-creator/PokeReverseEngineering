Possible Plans:

More SHINYS

To make a code writing software that runs after each gym is completed that will train the next gym leader to have a tailored team for P1

I could keep track of how P1 fights
- only a certain amount of memory, there will be triggers to reset the game
-- once every 10 fights lets say
A python script that is triggered with each restart of the game
- fight data then trains model


"Please restart the game for the rewarding of your badge"

Unless I have to write code for everysingle gym leader and their pokemon's mother!

Generative continuous world
- space for saving fight data
- reboot after completion of each level, generate world like a single directional treadmill
- continually rotates through cities and pokemon in the pokedex, slowly making more pokemon available and areas harder
- possibly rouge-like, possibly need a way to fight a poor grind cycle
